For this part of the project, I created the data modeling feature for my AquaTrack application. I created the Fish, Tank, and Feeding classes which I put in the models folder. 
I also created a DbContext class AquariumContext, which i put in the data folder. I added a connection string to the app settings and injected it into Program.cs.
I ran migration in package manager and updated the database.
