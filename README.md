For Week 11, I moved the business logic out of my MVC controllers and into a dedicated service class.
I created a new folder called Services and added an interface, IFishService, which defines several operations related to fish management. These include calculating a fish’s age in months, determining whether a tank is large enough for a given fish, and filtering fish by tank. I also created a concrete implementation, FishService, which contains the actual logic for these operations. This makes the code easier to maintain and test.
Next, I registered the service in the dependency injection container in Program.cs. I updated the FishController to use constructor injection and replaced controller level logic with calls to the new service.
The application now follows cleaner architectural boundaries. controllers manage flow, services handle logic, and the database layer performs persistence. This organization will help this to be easier to build.
