For Week 13, I implemented a diagnostics feature that exposes a /healthz endpoint. This endpoint provides the apps readiness and helps diagnose issues quickly without exposing sensitive information. This makes sure that it is reachable and functioning.
I created a DiagnosticsController that checks whether the application itself is running and whether the database is responding to SQL commands.
I also updated Program.cs to ensure MVC controller routing is added so the /healthz route is available. For testing, I viewed the endpoint in a browser and intentionally shut down the SQL Server service to confirm that the error response worked as expected.
