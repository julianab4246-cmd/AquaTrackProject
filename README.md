For this week, week 12, I implemented a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow for Fish in the application. This feature allows the app to list fish, view details, and create or edit fish.

First, I updated the FishController. I also put model validation directly into the Create and Edit actions.
Next, I added Razor views for Index, Details, Create, and Edit.
